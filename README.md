# hello-world
My very first. God is good!
So I'm a little bit conflicted on how this should go. On my way to the top, when should I make the drop?
Ohh... Hi, I'm Emma! I'm a petroleum and gas engineer but truth be told, I like coding. I like writing stuff
On my way to being a Data scientist, I learn at dataquest and coursera.
I'm actively looking for people to work with, help me grow in this new venture.
